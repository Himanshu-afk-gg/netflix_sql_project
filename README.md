# Netflix Content Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing Netflix's TV shows and movies to uncover insights and solve business-related problems using SQL. The dataset contains detailed information about Netflix's content library, including metadata such as titles, directors, casts, countries, release years, ratings, and more. By writing and executing SQL queries, the analysis aims to provide useful insights for decision-making.

## Objective
The main objective of this analysis is to answer several business-related questions, including:
- How many movies vs. TV shows are on Netflix?
- What is the most common rating?
- Which movies were released in specific years (e.g., 2020)?
- Which countries have the most content on Netflix?
- What is the longest movie?
- What content has been added in the last two years?
- What content has specific directors or has a certain number of seasons?
- How many content items are in each genre?

## Schema
The table `netflix` is structured as follows:

```sql

CREATE TABLE netflix(
    show_id VARCHAR(6),
    type VARCHAR(10),
    title VARCHAR(150),
    director VARCHAR(208),
    casts VARCHAR(1000),
    country VARCHAR(150),
    date_added VARCHAR(50),
    release_year INT,
    rating VARCHAR(10),
    duration VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in VARCHAR(105),
    description VARCHAR(250)
);

```

## Solutions
Here are the SQL queries used to answer each business problem:


### 1. Count the number of movies vs TV shows
```sql

SELECT type, COUNT(type) as total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type;

```

### 2. Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows
```sql
WITH temp_table AS(SELECT
type,
MAX(rating) as rating_name,
COUNT(rating) as total_rating,
RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(rating) DESC) as ranking
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type, rating
)

SELECT type,rating_name
FROM temp_table
WHERE ranking = 1;

```

### 3. List all movies released in a specific year (e.g. 2020)
```sql
SELECT
title as Movies_released_in_2020
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie' AND release_year = 2020;

```

### 4. Find the top 5 countries with the most content on Netflix
```sql
SELECT
	UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')) as distinct_country,
	COUNT(show_id)
	FROM netflix
	GROUP BY 1
	ORDER BY 2 DESC
	LIMIT 5;


```

### 5. Identify the longest Movie
```sql
SELECT
	title,
	type,
	CAST(REPLACE(duration,'min','') AS INT) AS minutes
	FROM netflix
		WHERE type = 'Movie'
		ORDER BY minutes desc;

```

### 6. Find content added in the last 2 years
```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(DATE_ADDED, 'MONTH DD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 years'

```

### 7. Find all movies/tv shows by the director 'Rajiv Chilaka'
```sql
SELECT
*
FROM netflix
WHERE director LIKE '%Rajiv Chilaka%';

```

### 8. List all TV shows with more than 5 seasons
```sql
SELECT
*
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'TV Show'
AND
SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::numeric > 5;

```

### 9. Count the number of content items in each genre
```sql
SELECT
UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ',')) as distinct_genre,
COUNT(listed_in) as total_count
FROM netflix
GROUP BY distinct_genre
ORDER BY total_count desc;

```

### 10. Find each years number of content released/added in india on netflix. return top 5 year with the highest content release/added
```sql
SELECT 
EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(date_added, 'MONTH DD, YYYY')) AS year,
COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 5;

```
